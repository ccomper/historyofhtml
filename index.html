    <h1>The History of HTML</h1>
    <p>Pre-1997 HTML was not driven by standards (wild west era)</p>
    <p>HTML 4.0 & 4.01 introduced in 1997. Basic standards set in place.</p>
    <p>XHTML 1.0, based on SML, introduced in 2000. WHATWG: HTML introduced in 2004 (Web hyper-text application technology group). This group was much less democratic than the traditional organization. WHATWG and W3C started to work together. They produced the current standard now, known as HTML5</p>

    <p>All major modern browsers today work as 'Evergreen' browsers. What that means is they silently update themselves on a users computer. Every browser is patched, for security reasons, constantly without the user knowing. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Explorer all work on this principle.</p>
